# Library Management System

## Overview

This project is a simple Library Management System implemented in C++. It simulates a basic library with functionalities such as adding books, managing users (Members and Administrators), borrowing and returning books, and displaying details of books and users.

### Features

1. **Book Management**: Add new books, display book details, and check the availability of books.
2. **User Management**: Add members and administrators, display user details, and allow members to borrow and return books.
3. **Error Handling**: The system provides basic error handling for operations such as borrowing unavailable books or returning books not borrowed by the member.

## Class Structure

1. **Book**: Represents a book with attributes like `bookID`, `title`, `author`, and `availability`. It provides a method to display book details.

2. **User**: A base class for all users in the system, containing attributes like `userID` and `name`.

3. **Member**: Derived from the `User` class, represents a library member. Members can borrow and return books.

4. **Administrator**: Derived from the `User` class, represents a library administrator. They have management capabilities (not fully implemented in this example).

5. **Library**: Manages a collection of books and users. It provides methods to add books and users, display all books and users, and find books by their ID.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C++ Compiler (e.g., `g++`)
- Standard Template Library (STL) included with your C++ compiler

### Compilation

To compile the project, use the following command:

```bash
g++ -o LibraryManagementSystem LibraryManagementSystem.cpp
```

### Running the Program

After compiling, run the executable:

```bash
./LibraryManagementSystem
```

### Example Usage

1. **Adding Books and Users**: The library object is created, and books are added to the library's collection. Users (members and administrators) are also added.
   
2. **Borrowing and Returning Books**: Members can borrow books if they are available and return them when done. The system updates the book's availability status accordingly.

3. **Display Details**: The library can display details of all books and users.

## Error Handling

- The program throws exceptions for scenarios such as trying to borrow a book that is not available or returning a book not borrowed by the user.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement additional administrative functions like adding/removing users and books.
- Extend the system to handle multiple copies of the same book.
- Add a database to persist user and book data across sessions.


This README file serves as a good starting point and can be modified to include any additional information or features you add to the project.
